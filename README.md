# 🧠 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project explores various machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. The goal is to compare model performances and understand which features are most predictive for cancer diagnosis.

## 📦 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)  
- **Samples**: 569 tumor cases  
- **Features**: 30 numerical features from fine-needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass  
- **Target**:  
  - `M` = Malignant  
  - `B` = Benign

## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and analyze breast cancer diagnostic data  
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models  
- Compare model performance using standard classification metrics  
- Identify key features using feature importance and model interpretation
